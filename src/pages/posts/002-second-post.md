Let's talk about HTML.

HTML is Hypertext Markup Language. Not sure why they didn't go for HML but I guess it's too late to change it now. Some would argue that HTML is a programming language--some, the other way around.

I say arguing about that is trivial and a waste of time. (I might regret this statement if I one day join a game show and the million-dollar question turns out to be exactly this.)

One thing that developers probably agree on, however, is that HTML is the skeleton of any web page. It provides the structure.
