Let's talk about HTML.

HTML is Hypertext Markup Language. Not sure why they didn't go for HML but I guess it's too late to change it now. Some would argue that HTML is a programming language--some, the other way around.

I say arguing about that is trivial and a waste of time. (I might regret this statement if I one day join a game show and the million-dollar question turns out to be exactly this.)

One thing that developers probably agree on, however, is that HTML is the skeleton of any web page. The structure, if you will.

You will probably come across some tutorials or other articles that tell you to learn HTML only on the surface level. The reasoning is usually along the lines of the notion that HTML is not that complex of a topic. After all, what can be so difficult about indenting elements where they're supposed to be intended, right?

Ah, well. If it were that simple. There's so much to learn about HTML such as using semantic tags and adhering to accessibility. Accessibility, in particular, is becoming more relevant these days. You don't want to be the next pizza company who's sued because a visitor wasn't able to read your light gray text over a white background.

It's also interesting to note that some advanced JavaScript developers may not even know about the ```<picture>``` tag.

I'm definitely not saying that everyone should spend their entire careers mastering HTML and memorizing every element's default display behavior (block or inline). But at the very least, give HTML--the skeleton of a webpage--some love.
